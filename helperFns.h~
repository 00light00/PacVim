/* Write/Read Manager
 When the game is being played, sometimes weird
 characters will appear randomly. When multithreading is not
 used, this bug disappears. I believe the characters appear
 because the read/write methods are being used at the same time
 (from concurrent threads), which can lead to weird behavior,
 
 With WR manager, all these methods (charAt, writeAt, etc) are done
 sequentially, the order determined by a priority queue. The player's
 keystrokes take priority.
